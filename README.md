# weatherData

In this project I performed an end to end ETL pipeline with barebones python (no framework).

I fetched the invetory and stations data from the ncdc weather stations.

I then cleaned the data and found the closest station to my location.

I then stored the cleaned data in a sqlite3 database in my file system to persist the data.

I finished the project by plotting the maximum, minimum and average of the temperature data using pandas
